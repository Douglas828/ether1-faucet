# Ether-1 Faucet
This is the GitHub repository for the public Ether-1 faucet available [here](faucet.ether1.org "Ether-1 Faucet")

If you want to use the faucet, there is no need to clone this repository and run it yourself. Simply go to the aforementioned link, input your wallet address, and click "Recieve". Please note that the faucet has a **24 hour cooldown**. This is to prevent the faucet address from running out of funds faster than we can deposit, and to prevent automated bot spam.

This is an open source faucet for transparency and to encourage other community members to help out with places they see fit. Anyone is welcome to suggest or implement ideas. This project is by the community, for the community. With that being said, please do not exploit the system - **your addresses / IP may be banned!**

The faucet wallet address is "0xSomethingInTheFuture"

Any donations to the faucet address will be sent back out again.

If you'd like to donate to the developer(s) of the faucet, please see the addresses at the bottom of the page.

A big thank you to everyone who is a part of the community, and to those who have donated to the faucet. I hope to make a file available that automatically logs every address and the amount of ETHO they have donated to the faucet address. But for now, here is that list 

(Note: This list does not auto update and does not reflect the donations that have been sent. Please contact Douglas#9458 with proof of it being your address, along with the name you'd like to be displayed as).
